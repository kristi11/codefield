This is a platform where everyone can share their work. it includes a user dashboard and an admin dashboard. to access the admin dashboard you can go to `yourUrl.com/login`. To enter the admin dashboard go to the admin url and reset the password.You can do that by connecting laravel to mailtrap. the admin email is `tanellari@gmail.com`. After you've entered the admin dashboard you have all the admin privileges. From there you can add/edit/remove other adminers amongst other things. You can change the current admin email to any email you desire. Keep in mind that emails have a unique db value. This project has been private for sometime so don't mind the naming of the commits. This project is created with laravel 5.4 and bootstrap 3. Also i have used the `Material Dashboard` template from `Creative tim` just to speed up the proccess of getting everything up and running. To get everything running just download or clone the project and run `composer install`. Now this project has been online for a while and just recently i've decided to take it offline and make it opensource so maybe some of the community can benefit from it. Since its been online for a while i had to do certain modifications to the database so i wouldn't rely on the migrations. Instead a copy of the current database setup is located in the root of the project. You can just copy/paste it and you'll be good to go. Hopefully this is of help to someone :)
